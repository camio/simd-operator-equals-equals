# Abstract

SIMD Types from the Parallelism TS are proposed for adoption in C++26. Deviating
from standard value-semantic types, the `==` operator for SIMD types returns a
mask instead of `bool`. This inconsistency detrimentally effects user
experience. We instead recommend that `==` and related operators return `bool`
with masked variants provided as free functions.

### Before

```cpp
using uint32_4v = std::fixed_size_simd<std::uint32_t, 4>;

class Color {
public:
  bool operator==(const SimdColor &) const = default;
private:
  uint32_4v data_;
};

void f() {
  Color a, b;
  // ...
  if( a == b )         // ERROR: use of deleted function 'Color::operator=='
     //...
}
```

### After

```cpp
using uint32_4v = std::fixed_size_simd<std::uint32_t, 4>;

class Color {
public:
  bool operator==(const SimdColor &) const = default;
private:
  uint32_4v data_;
};

void f() {
  Color a, b;
  // ...
  if( a == b )         // OKAY
     //...
}
```

# Introduction

The Parallelism TS 2, @N4808, includes data-parallel types that enable the
portable utilization of "single instruction, multiple data" (SIMD) CPU
capabilities. Matthias Kretz proposes standardizing these types with some
modifications (hereafter referred to as `std::simd`) in @P1928R3, "Merge
Data-Parallel Types From the Parallelism TS 2". This initiative prompted working
sessions at C++Now 2023 that analyzed `std::simd` from a usability perspective.

Notably, the behavior and return type of `==` for `simd` types was discussed. As
currently defined, `==` performs element-wise equality and returns a `simd_mask`
of the result. Given `simd` objects `v1` and `v2` with values `1,2,3,4` and
`1,4,3,6`, `v1 == v2` has value `1,0,1,0`. This is consistent with other `simd`
operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.

While this behavior appears promising, it runs contrary to long established
convention with value semantic types in C++. The departure results in increased
complexity and unexpected behavior in user code. After lengthy discussions, a
poll was taken at C++Now indicating a strong preference for conventional `==`
semantics for `simd` types:

*operator== should return a scalar bool*

| SF | F  | N | A | SA |
| -- | -- | - | - | -- |
| 9  | 10 | 0 | 1 |  0 |

In the following sections we outline the arguments leading to this result by
reviewing value semantics, considering its application to `std::simd` types, and
looking at existing practices.

# Value semantics and its advantages

- Introduce value semantics
- Discuss C++ rendering
- Discuss advantages of uniform treatment

# std::simd types and value semantics

- Provide the two examples
- Show frustration at failure points

# Existing practice

There exists many libraries which wrap SIMD operations today.
Some libraries more explicitly wrap a single SIMD register, like VCL or xsimd,  where others express larger arrays or mathematical objects.
The following table covers some open source libraries and their choices with respect to comparison operators.

| Library                            | Comparison Behavior                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Armadillo                          | Element-wise                                                     |
| Blaze                              | Regular                                                          |
| EVE                                | Element-wise                                                     |
| Eigen::Array                       | Element-wise                                                     |
| Eigen::{Matrix, RowVector, Vector} | Regular                                                          |
| Fastor                             | Element-wise                                                     |
| VCL                                | Element-wise                                                     |
| xsimd                              | Element-wise                                                     |
| xtensor                            | Regular `operator==` and `operator!=`; rest are element-wise[^1] |

## Wrappers and DSLs

These libraries exist broadly in two categories: wrappers around SIMD operations and DSLs (domain specific languages) for doing math and multidimensional array operations.
For libraries that are conceptually DSLs: users are unlikely to switch away from these high level tools.
If end users want to use a DSL, they will be shielded from the particular syntactic choices used by `std::simd` and this is an irrelevant decision for them.

For users who want to introduce a small amount of data parallelism in their code, or are implementers of a DSL, having regular comparison will fit more naturally into rest of the C++ language for the reasons stated above.
Non-DSL users will still see a considerable benefit with respect to conciseness and clarity over using platform specific intrinsic operations, even with value-semantics.
For example if we compare one of the algorithms in [@P1928R3] which used element-wise `operator>=`, the new proposal is not considerably more verbose nor unclear:

```diff
 using floatv = std::simd<float>
 using intv = std::rebind_simd_t<int, floatv>;

 int count_positive(const std::vector<floatv>& xs) {
     // simplify generated assembly:
     if (x.size() == 0) std::unreachable();
     intv counter = {};
     for (std::simd x : xs) {
-        counter += x > 0;
+        counter += @_greater_@(x, 0);
     }
     return reduce(counter);
 }
```

# Conclusion

Stuffies...

[^1]: This option is only used in xtensor, not even the related project xsimd.
      The inconsistency seems more likely to cause bugs than selecting either behavior by itself.
