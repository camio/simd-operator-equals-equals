# Introduction

Set context:

- std::simd being proposed for standardization
- Discussions at C++Now conference. Point out the poll numbers
- Point out benefits of value semantics for std::simd types
- Point out status quo that we are trying to change

[@P1371] is an example citation. We'll need to cite the SIMD paper

# Value semantics and its advantages

- Introduce value semantics
- Discuss C++ rendering
- Discuss advantages of uniform treatment

# std::simd types and value semantics

- Provide the two examples
- Show frustration at failure points

# Existing practice

- Show table of what's there.
- Provide argument how coherence of the standard library should weigh strongly
  here where it might not in some of these other contexts.

# Conclusion

Stuffies...
